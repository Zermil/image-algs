# image-algs

Simple algorithms to: 
- Read an image file
- Write an image file
- Encode pixels for an image file

This code is used for presentational and educational purposes, because of that most (if not all) of it
is not optimized, it's just there to show the basic functionality of some of the algorithms in an easy-to-follow way.

## Build and Run

Remember to change `MSVC_PATH` variable in the `build.bat` file

```console
> build
```

```console
> cd build
> [PROGRAM].exe
```
